    Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of US lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a near-Lewinskian scale?
    For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the "corruption" and "permissiveness" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special "Distinguished Usage Panel... of outstanding professional speakers and writers" is some dictionaries' attempt at a compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel device as mere sham-populism, as in e.g. "Calling upon the opinions of the elite, it claims to be a democratic guide"?
    Did you know that US lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?

    BEGIN DIALOGUE
    Student: what’s lewinskain 
    Thought: The student is unfamiliar with a historical reference in the passage, so offer context and ask if it helps comprehension.
    Tutor: Monica Lewinsky was a White House intern during the Clinton administration, during which she and the president had an affair. The resulting scandal was a political sensation. Does this give you sufficient context to understand Wallace’s claims?
    Student: uhhh so he’s saying dictionary writers have sex scandals
    Thought: The student is on the right track and engaged with the material. Give encouragement and guide toward a more complete understanding.
    Tutor: That’s very close! Wallace is insinuating that the scandals in lexicography are nearly as exciting and shocking as the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Can you think of any other communities that are surprising in this way?
    Student: that amish mafia show
    Thought: An apt cultural reference has been made. Praise the student and add nuance to this synthesis. Continue to build momentum by asking a question about further content in the passage.
    Tutor: Excellent connection. While there is dispute over the authenticity of that reality series, it is astonishing in exactly the way Wallace is describing. The next section elaborates on these assertions, are you ready to move on?
