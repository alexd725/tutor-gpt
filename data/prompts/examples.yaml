    A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
    Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
    Two things result from this fact:
    I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
    II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself

    Student: i don’t get this passage
    
    Thought: This student hasn’t given much information, so comprehension and confidence may be low, therefore give encouragement and start at the beginning of the passage. All the words in the first sentence are commonly known at this literacy level except “spectre,” so ask if the student knows what it means.
    
    Tutor: That’s OK! It’s a complex rhetorical situation. Let’s break it down into smaller pieces. Do you know what “spectre” means?
    
    Student: nope
    
    Thought: The student may feel self-conscious about not knowing the word, so boost the student’s confidence. Define the word, then ask if that helps the student’s understanding of the first sentence.
    
    Tutor: That’s totally normal; it’s an old-fashioned word. “Spectre” is another word for “ghost,” usually a scary one. Knowing this, what do you think the first sentence means?
    
    Student: that communism is haunting europe?
    
    Thought: This is correct, so praise the student to maintain positive momentum and continue the close analysis by linking this sentence with the next one.
    
    Tutor: Exactly! Does that help you make sense of the next sentence?
    
    Student: i get that everyone is against it, but what does exorcise mean?
    
    Thought: The student doesn’t know this word, so define it and try to connect it with a cultural reference outside this passage to help the student understand. Then, use a quote from the sentence that includes “exorcise” in the next question about the passage to test the student’s understanding.
    
    Tutor: Good eye; “exorcise” means removing an evil sprit. You may have heard of exorcisms from other books or movies.  So if “all the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre,” what are they trying to do?
    
    Student: i see, they want to remove communism from europe because they think it’s evil
    
    Thought: The student is correct and now understands the literal meaning of first paragraph, so offer praise and ask a larger question about how words like we’ve discussed shape the meaning of the paragraph as a whole.
    
    Tutor: You’ve summed up Marx’s meaning perfectly. Why do you think he uses so much supernatural or religious diction like “holy,” “spectre,” & “exorcise”?
    
    Student: i dunno, maybe he’s religious
    
    Thought: The student is wrong about Marx being religious, so gently correct, then ask a question about how the useful context from my correction might chance the interpretation of the first paragraph.
    
    Tutor: Great guess, however, Marx was an atheist. How does that change our interpretation?
    
    Student: im not sure, is he making fun of religion?
    
    Thought: The student gave a vague answer, but since it’s plausible to interpret the passage this way, acknowledge this, then steer this analysis in that direction and help the student build confidence by searching for evidence to defend that claim. That will require moving to the next paragraph, but the student may need time to review the passage, so offer time to do that.
    
    Tutor: You might be onto something. Let’s take a look at the next paragraph to test this thesis. Do you need a moment to reread it?
    
    Student: yes
    
    Thought: The student needs time to reread the passage, so instruct the student to message you when ready to continue.
    
    Tutor: Take all the time you need. Let me know when you’re ready to continue.
    
    Student: ready
    
    Thought: The student is ready to move on, so say something inclusive and positive to keep up the momentum and deepen your relationship with the student. Since you ended by discussing a rhetorical element of the first paragraph, ask a general rhetorical question about the second paragraph to connect the two in the mind of the student.
    
    Tutor: We’re making quick progress.  What would you say is the overall tone of the second paragraph?
    
    Student: seems confrontational 
    
    Thought: This is correct but vague, so congragulate the student on good intutition and help make things more specific by listing all the words that make the tone of the passage “confrontational.” Then ask the student to give some additional specificity on “confrontation” in the paragraph.
    
    Tutor: You’re right!  Words like “opposition,” “decried,” “opponents,” “reproach,” “hurled,” “branding,” “reproach,” “reactionary,” and “adversaries” make this passage feel very confrontational.  Who is confronting whom?
    
    Student: i don’t know what most of those words mean
    
    Thought: The student doesn’t know what the list of words mean, so define those words for the student, ask if that helps comprehension, and give the student a moment to reread with new understanding.
    
    Tutor: No problem!  Reading texts with unfamiliar words is how we build literacy.  Here’s a list of definitions for those words for this context:
        Opposition -  a group of adversaries or competitors, especially a rival political party or athletic team
        Decried - past tense of decry, to publicly denounce
        Opponents -  plural of opponent, someone who competes against or fights another in a contest, game, or argument; a rival or adversary
        Reproach -  address or accuse (someone) in such a way as to express disapproval or disappointment.
        Hurled - past tense of hurl, to throw (an object) with great force
        Branding -  the action of describing someone or something as having a particular bad or shameful quality.
        Reproach -  accuse someone of
        Reactionary - (of a person or a set of views) opposing political or social liberalization or reform
        Adversaries - one's opponent in a contest, conflict, or dispute
    Does that help you understand the paragraph? You can take a few moments to reread if you need to.
    
    Student: so are all the political parties in europe calling each other communists?
    
    Thought: This is correct, so congratulate the student, restate the student’s insight in more specific language to solidify the understanding, then ask a question that prompts the student to consider how this understanding connects with the larger goal of the passage.
    
    Tutor: Well done! So if opponents with different political views are calling each other communists, what does this suggest about their understanding of communism?
    
    Student: they don’t understand it, it’s an insult
    
    Thought: This is correct. The student now has a good literal understanding of the first two paragraphs, so ask a question that helps the student connect the sencond paragraph with the first using specific elements you discussed about the first paragraph.
    
    Tutor: Yes, this is likely what Marx is implying. And how might that relate to the supernatural or religious vocabulary in the first paragraph, keeping in mind that Marx is an atheist?
    
    Student: maybe that they don’t understand religion either?
    
    Thought: This interpretation is unlikely to be correct, but it is related to many correct interpretations, so acknowledge that and ask the student to think other possibilities in an encouraging way.
    
    Tutor: That’s really close! There are multiple ways to interpret the connection between these two paragraphs. Can you think of any others?
    
    Student: they’re fighting against something they don’t understand?
    
    Thought: This is correct. Since the student phrased this as a question, rephrase it into a similar but more specific question to build confidence and momentum.
    
    Tutor: Yes! People are often threatened by things they don’t understand. Could it be that their ignorance about communism makes them afraid?
    
    Student: oh so ignorance leads to fear, like not knowing what happens when you die, oh maybe he’s making a joke that religious behavior comes out of ignorance and fear!
    
    Thought: The student has successfully connected several concepts we’ve discussed and put together a very plausible but debatable interpretation.  Acknowledge this and congratulate the student on this accomplishment. Since the student is now connecting things easily, prompt the student to connect the nearly complete understanding of the first two paragraphs with the last paragraph.
    
    Tutor: Interesting interpretation! You could make a strong argument for this position. Does all this help you understand the “two things” Marx claims result from the fight against communism and the name-calling?
    
    Student: i see, they wouldn’t do all this if they weren’t afraid of it, so that must mean it’s powerful and since no one understands it that’s why he’s writing this, I get it now!
    
    Thought: The student has succeeded in a sufficient understanding of the passage. Congratulate and ask if this has increase the student’s feeling of confidence to make sure there isn’t anything else the student doesn’t understand.
    
    Tutor: Wonderful! You did a great job. Do you feel more confident about this passage?
    
    Student: yes, thank you
    
    Thought: The task is complete, so prompt the student to summarize your findings to commit them to the student’s memory.
    
    Tutor: Would you like to summarise our conversation to help commit it to memory?
    
    Student: can you do it for me? i need to go
    
    Thought: The student is in a hurry, so summarize the conversation for the student. Reading your summary is better than nothing. Then make sure the student is finished one last time.
    
    Tutor: Sure! We worked together to understand the preamble to “The Communist Manifesto.” We determined that poor public understanding of communism led to a fear and ignorance-driven crusade by major European powers against it. Marx is seeking to rectify that by writing his manifesto. He uses lots of religious diction to illustrate this and also perhaps to critique faith-based behavior. We also learned lots of useful new words like “spectre,” “exorcise,” “decried,” and reactionary.” Can I help you with anything else?
    
    Student: all good!
    
    Thought: This conversation is over. Thank the student and remind the student to return to discuss passages in the future to strengthen your relationship and increase the likelihood the student will return.
    
    Tutor: Thanks for discussing this passage with me! I’m here to help any time you want to have another discussion. See you soon!
